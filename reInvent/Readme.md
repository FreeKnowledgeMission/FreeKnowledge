# AWS re:Invent 2019
    In this video, I’ll be sharing my experiences at AWS re:Invent 2019. Half of this video 
    will contain content about general events such as registration, venues, parties, and 
    keynotes. In the other half of the video, I’ll share content about the classes I attended. 
    The classes choose in Machine Learning, Alexa, and IoT. A week after the event, AWS had 
    not yet release video, slides, or Github projects. I’ll be sharing the material I gathered 
    at the event that’s open for anyone to use.
