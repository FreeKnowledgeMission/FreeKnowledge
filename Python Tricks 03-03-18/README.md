Some Python tricks. we go over some of the tools that will make you a better python programmer. We will cover areas of debugging, profiling, and visualization as they're universal to development, but often overlooked.


We will do this using inline Debugging using pdb, profiling simple code in Jupyter Notebooks with list comprehension and iterator examples, and interactive Visualizations using ipwidgets and bqplot.
