 # Why do we want to ask better questions? 
    Questions lead to better questions. Better questions lead to better
    decisions. Better decision making can lead to a more fulfilling life.

# Effective questions can help us with
    1. Overcoming social anxiety (in-person, in groups, on social media)
    Be able to talk to anyone 
    2. Connect with people and establish relationships. 
    3. Solve a problem more quickly - Be a curious problem-solver
    Sometimes ask the obvious question. Sometimes people are 
    afraid to ask the obvious.
    4. It’s important to ask the unknown rather than the known. Pay 
    attention to the story and listen for gaps. If someone has stated 
    they looked at something, form this information as a question 
    that’s already been answered. 
    5. Ask what’s changed in the situation.
### Understand the world around us 
    1. Learn about a topic quickly  
    2. Conversations can be in the form of an interview 
    3. Questions can organize our thinking around what we know 
    and don’t know.  
    It helps us start with the basics and simplify. If we can 
    think in terms 
    of analogies, it helps us frame a relevant question.

# How do we ask better questions?

### When asking others

    1. Start with a general question to get to know a person and 
    what they are interested in.
    2. What are you’re hobbies? Generally, people are passionate about
     their hobbies because they perform them in their free time and 
     don’t make any money. 
    3. Follow-up with a question with more depth
    4. Look for signals when they light up and comments you can relate to.
    5. Don’t be afraid of asking a simple question. If you don’t know 
    what to ask because you are new to the subject, ask for them to share
    a story or experience and listen for something interesting. For example, 
    how did that experience of your journey make you feel?
    6. Be curious about the person and subject they are talking about. 
    Do your best not to judge and pay attention to what they have to say.
    7. Strive for empathy. Understand their experience and perspective.
    8. Consider your knowledge of the topic. Ask questions about the 
    problems you have faced relative to the topic.

### When asking ourselves 
Ask big questions such as
    1. Why are we here, what’s my purpose
    2. What are the biggest problems in the world
    3. Am I asking the right questions
    4. What good question did I ask today
