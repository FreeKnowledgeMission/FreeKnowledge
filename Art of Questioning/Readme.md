    Sometimes ask the obvious question. Sometimes people are afraid to ask the obvious.
    It’s important to ask the unknown rather than the known. Pay attention to the story and listen for gaps. If someone has stated they looked at something, form this information as a question that’s already been answered. Look 
    Ask what’s changed in the situation.
    Understand the world around us 
    Learn about a topic quickly  
    Conversations can be in the form of an interview

#How do we ask better questions?

#When asking others

    Start with a general question to get to know a person and what they are interested in.
    What are you’re hobbies? Generally, people are passionate about their hobbies because they perform them in their free time and don’t make any money. 
    Follow-up with a question with more depth
    Look for signals when they light up and comments you can relate to.

    Don’t be afraid of asking a simple question. If you don’t know what to ask because you are new to the subject, ask for them to share a story or experience and listen for something interesting. For example, how did that experience of your journey make you feel?
    Be curious about the person and subject they are talking about. Do your best not to judge and pay attention to what they have to say.
    Strive for empathy. Understand their experience and perspective.
    Consider your knowledge of the topic. Ask questions about the problems you have faced relative to the topic.

#When asking ourselves 
Ask big questions such as
    Why are we here, what’s my purpose
    What are the biggest problems in the world
    Am I asking the right questions
    What good question did I ask today
