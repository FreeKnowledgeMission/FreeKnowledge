### Here's our end result to plot Twitter sentiment for a word such as "President"

Before we can begin plotting we need to understand NLTK or Natural Language Toolkit in Python. The first 15 lessons are how we can process words to prepare for Machine Learning.

### Python Code in this project
 - 01 Tokenizing - Split text into sentences or words
 - 02 Stop Words - Filler words not as useful in data analysis (and, of, the)
 - 03 Stemming - Removes suffixes or prefixes to its root word
 - 04 Speech Tagging - Labels each word with its part of speech (verb, adverb, noun, etc)
 - 05 Chunking - Group words and graphing them
 - 06 Chinking - Remove words that you don't want from Chunking
 - 07 Named Entity - Similar to chunking, categorizes words into predefined classes.
 - 08 Lemmatizing - Improved method of stemming. Can also group root words for comparison.
 - 09 Corpora - Large text such as journals, dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc
 - 10 Wordnet - Large online database you can use to grab words to process
 - 11 Text Classifier - Used for grouping text in categories such as stocks, writings, politics. This lesson classifies the top 15 most common words. (Opinion mining)
 - 12 Words as Features - Creates words as features. In case marks words to True or False that way they can be trained
 - 13 Naive Bayes - Basic algorithm that search group of text(positive) and filters for a word to compare against the second group of text(negative).
 - 14 Pickle - Saved previously trained algorithms or python objects (Machine Learning runs faster)
 - 15 Scikit - Short lesson on importing and using libraries MultinomiaNB, GaussianNB, BernoulliNB, Linear Regression, SGDClassifer, SVC, LincearSVC, NuSVC
 - 16 Vote - Create a new classifier that gives each algorithm a point. Based on the results, assign confidence based on a total number of votes.
 - 17 Bias - What is the average of positive vs average of negative. You might have 80 percent accuracy in negative and 60 percent positive giving you an average of 70 percent. 
 - 18 Training - Imports a new dataset that is similar to Twitter text. In the previous case, the text was too short cause more results to be negative. An example, in the negative reviews, the sentences are longer give more negative words. In positive reviews, the sentences are shorter, giving less positive words.
 - 19 Sentiment - Create our own sentiment modules to test our own positive and negative review. The first part is to pick each classifier. The second part is to open, load, and save the module. The third part will create two example reviews and run sentiment on it.
 - 20 Twitter App - Build your Twitter app and get your API keys
 - 21 Graphing - Plot a keyword.
